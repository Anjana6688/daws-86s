Why not Ansible is used for Infra?

Ansible can create infra, but it can't manage/update infra because of no state management feature available in ansible, originally created for configuration management not good for infra management..
Use terraform for infra creation, once servers are created by terraform handover them to ansible, ansible completes configuration in the server

Terraform: Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp,HCL -> Hashicorp configuration language

Key features and benefits:
=================================
Version control
Automatic CRUD
Consistent infra -> DEV, QA, UAT, PRE-PROD, PERF, PROD
Inventory -> What are the services we are using in cloud
Cost optimisation
Time saving and no human errors
Dependency -> SG, EC2 and then R53
Modular reusable infra
Session-30
================
Hashicorp configuration language syntax:
--------------------------------------------
{
key ="value"
}

resource "type_of_resource" "name-of-resource" {
	
	key = value
	
}

terraform init -> downloads the provider, intialise terraform
We need to use terraform provider.tf code in our repository then need to use this command .
you can find the code in https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance
COMMANDS:
----------
terraform plan -> It will give us a plan that what it is going to do
terraform apply -> creates the infra as given in the plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve

Variables:
==============
Syntax for vailable:

variable "variable_name" {
	default = "value-of-variable"
}

If you neeed to call the variable use var.variable_name
Note: Variable names should be anything our wish but when we give resource name thats should be as in terraform 

We have written sample code for creating ec2 and security groups reference from terraform doc.
Also variable priority like 
1. command line variable values have first prefernce
2. terraform.tfvars (this we need to give same file no changes to be done.
3. env variable TF_VAR_<variable_name>
4. default value
5. finally prompt

which means if you define an existing variable in cmd it will take the value from command line.
you can check with terraform doc for cmd line.

Conditions:
============
Condition-syintax condition ? true_value : false_value

in variable.tf i have defined as variable 
variable "environment" {
    default = "dev"
}
then i have added a condition in ec2.tf like
    instance_type = var.environment == "dev" ? "t3.micro" : "t3.medium" 
then the variable i have defined as dev so after i have applied the terraform plan then then i can get the t3.micro instance as that is the true conditon.

terraform Plan -Output 
instance_state                       = (known after apply)
      + instance_type                        = "t3.micro"
 Loops
==========================================================
count:
======
In Terraform there count word which will represents a loop and create multiple environments..
wheneverwe use count it will give special variable count.index.
It works with List more frequently.
SO i have created three instances with different names for that i have done
i have created a variable.tf
variable "instances" {
    default = [ "Mongodb", "Reddis", "Mysql" ]
}
and in loop.tf
tags = {
        Name = var.instances[count.index]
        Terraform = "true"
    }

I have added the count.index which means when index is 0 then it will create Mongodb. viseversa forother index as well.
DATE: 05-11-2025
Till now we have created a three instances for that now we are creating records.
for that we are using this code https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route53_record
aws route53 records.
In route 53.tf we have combined two variables.
name    = "var.instances[count.index].var.domain"
we have combined two variables this concept calls Interpolation.
Interpolation/concatination:
===========================
To do concatination of variables we use use ${variable}
name    = "${var.instances[count.index]}.${var.domain}"

/*******Session -30 -completed in this sessioon we have create loop,records and instances using that loop.***/
How to check the output iof resource???
We can give awsintance.terraform in output.tf file when we give terrafom apply command it will show the output
which(awsintance.terraform) means type_of_resource.name_of_resource.
FOR-LOOP:
=========
       Count basedd loop are used to itterates list,where as for loops are used for map.
	   List consists "string values"
	   Map consists "Key and values"[suppose if you define front-end ="ip-address" here front-end is KEY and ip-address is VALUE]
	   The for_each meta-argument accepts a map or a set of strings and creates an instance for each item in that map or set.
	   Map always consists key value pairs.
	  syntax for map:
	  -------------
	      {
		     key = value
			 key2=value2
		   }
		   
	      key = value,this entire entry is taken as one each statement so each.key and each.value it will consider whenever for_each itterates.
		  if we want to declare multiple values we use list but to use it in for_each we need to convert it to string by using  toset() and tomap() or we can use Map.
		  By using we are converting the list so map need key-value so we are converting the below list to map 
           		  variable "instances" {
					default = {
        mongodb="t3.micro"
        redis="t3.micro"
        mysql="t2.micro"

    }
}

     here terraform sample code from docs
	 resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  for_each = tomap({
    a_group       = "eastus"
    another_group = "westus2"
  })
  name     = each.key
  location = each.value
}

Our modified code 

resource "aws_instance" "terraform" {
    ami = "ami-09c813fb71547fc4f"
	for_each =var.instances
    instance_type = "t3.micro"
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_all.id]
    tags = {
        Name = "terraform-1"
        Terraform = "true"
    }
}
NOTE: count is suitable for itterae list we will get count.index
for_each is good for map we will get eack.key and each.value
if u want to irrerate list through for_each then we can use
for_each = toset(list) we ned to call it via each.value
