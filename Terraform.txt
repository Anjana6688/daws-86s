Why not Ansible is used for Infra?

Ansible can create infra, but it can't manage/update infra because of no state management feature available in ansible, originally created for configuration management not good for infra management..
Use terraform for infra creation, once servers are created by terraform handover them to ansible, ansible completes configuration in the server

Terraform: Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp,HCL -> Hashicorp configuration language

Key features and benefits:
=================================
Version control
Automatic CRUD
Consistent infra -> DEV, QA, UAT, PRE-PROD, PERF, PROD
Inventory -> What are the services we are using in cloud
Cost optimisation
Time saving and no human errors
Dependency -> SG, EC2 and then R53
Modular reusable infra

Hashicorp configuration language syntax:
--------------------------------------------
{
key ="value"
}

resource "type_of_resource" "name-of-resource" {
	
	key = value
	
}

terraform init -> downloads the provider, intialise terraform
We need to use terraform provider.tf code in our repository then need to use this command .
you can find the code in https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance
terraform plan -> It will give us a plan that what it is going to do
terraform apply -> creates the infra as given in the plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve

Variables:
==============
Syntax for vailable:

variable "variable_name" {
	default = "value-of-variable"
}

If you neeed to call the variable use var.variable_name
Note: Variable names should be anything our wish but when we give resource name thats should be as in terraform 

We have written sample code for creating ec2 and security groups reference from terraform doc.
Also variable priority like 
1.cmd
2..tfvar
3. .tf files
which means if you define an existing variable in cmd it will take the value from command line.
you can check with terraform doc for cmd line.
