Why not Ansible is used for Infra?

Ansible can create infra, but it can't manage/update infra because of no state management feature available in ansible, originally created for configuration management not good for infra management..
Use terraform for infra creation, once servers are created by terraform handover them to ansible, ansible completes configuration in the server

Terraform: Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp,HCL -> Hashicorp configuration language

Hashicorp configuration language syntax:

}
