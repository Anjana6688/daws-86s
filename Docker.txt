DOCKER:

 Intially there is front end and backend is avail in one server so difficult in release.
After that Monolithic came-->Frontend -> Backend(Entire app should be in single programming language)
Microservices:
==============
Catalogue, Cart, Shipping
API
every component in diff programming language
for microservers we dont need application servers.
if you want port 8080 it will open individually.

for small application suppose a 3MB we don't need any of the 3 mentioned in above.
To avoid containers came.

Bare Metal Server:
====================
Its a similar to individual house..
If we purchase server we need to install everything and if you dont need the entire space then this is waste.

Def:
Bare metal servers are dedicated physical machine resources offered by a cloud service provider. 
The entire machine is dedicated to the ISV. The operating system is loaded directly onto the machine, the ISV’s app runs on that OS,
 and the app has exclusive access to all the computing resources on that machine.
 
 Virtualiszation:
 ==================
 Its like flats ,entire space we segrated to some 100 flats so the space utilisation is more.
 Virtualisation is means it has hypervisor which will seperate the physical servers into multiple VM's so that there is whatvere space we required we can create VM for that.

What is hypervisor?
Hypervisor is responsible to create a virtual machines(virtual environments which act as a virtal computer it consists their own CPU  it will not break Physical server.)
Most famous hypervisor are vmware,this entire process called Virtulisation.
for example.

Containersation
===================
Its like a PG. even that small room will be more space utilisation with less downtime.
Its has coontainers.

Virtulisation	vs		Containerisation
Costly					Cheaper
More boot time			less boot time
more size				less size
resource utilisation	resource utilisation is more
is less
More privacy			Less privacy
Less portable			More portable

For containersation we are using docker.

How to nstall docker.
Create one VM/EC2 in Aws.
Install these commands in that server (mobaxterm)
TO INSTALL DOCKER USE THESE BELOW COMMANDS.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/

Whenever we install docker a docker group is created only root user and users inside docker group will have acess to docker cli
To add ec2-user we need to use the below command.
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
exit and login again

[ ec2-user@ip-172-31-20-188 ~ ]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES

Container is nothing But Server.

what is image? why docker is famous.

AMI(Amazon Machine Image) = OS + System Packages + App run time + App code + App libraries -> Amazon machine image

Docker image = Bare minimum OS(10Mb) + System Packages + App run time + App code + App libraries -> Amazon machine image
500Mb

DOCKER had OS which is bare minimum OS which will  allow very less for Images,thats thereason docker is famous.
